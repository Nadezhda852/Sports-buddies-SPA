1. Introduction 
This assessment aims at creating a responsive single page web-application (SPA) that supports Solent University students in some aspect of their day-to-day lives which is underestimated and in need. As a full time student, full time employee and 24/7 mother and wife, it appears challenging to me to find time for myself and more specifically for sport activities. When thinking about this overlooked aspect of my live, I was confident that I am not alone in this struggle and majority of Solent University students are finding themselves in this same situation. My focus is to attempt to tackle this issue, that neglected part of students day-to-day live by creating a single page web-application. The intended purpose of the application is to be used by the students as a journal where they will add and track their daily physical activities from casual walks along the campus, short stretch activities after a long day to high intense interval training (HIIT) and long-distance runs. The end goal of the SPA is by shedding light on the daily, weekly, and monthly levels of physical activity, to motivate students to commit more time towards their health by exercising. 

2. Methodology
After considering different techniques for the overarching methodology in AE1, I have chosen Design Thinking approach. Aside its popularity among some blue-chip companies like Apple, Google and Samsung which has rapidly adopted it to better understand and serve their client. Design thinking helps us observe and build empathy with the target users, improves our ability to question, question everything from the exact problem to the spreading assumptions and implications.
For this assignment we need to decide on a development methodology. After a thorough research for suitable development methodology, I decided to implement Personal Extreme Programming (PXP). Why PXP? PXP is a software development process formulated for autonomous developers. These are software engineers who implement software solutions without being part of a team, a free-lance developers.  The initial model of autonomous developers was created in the early 90s as a result of IT outsourcing and offshoring with a primary goal to enhance product quality and decrease the labour costs. Given our assignment 2 (AE2) is an individual work and we are expected to work on our own, I consider PXP methodology as a suitable one. Furthermore, it is based on some principles such as disciplined approach in following and applying PXP practices, measuring, tracking and analysing daily work, account for learning curve - the developer should learn from their performance and try to improve it. PXP involves continuous testing aiming at detecting bugs and errors at an earlier possible development stage when the cost of fixing these are lower. It also emphases on the automation of the daily work.    
As an agile process for autonomous developers, PXP comprises of a couple of process phases to start with establishing the client's requirements, planning, iteration initialisation, design, implementation, system testing and retrospective. It should be mentioned that the implementation stage consists 3 more stages: unit testing, code and refactor. Despite, it appears as a lengthy process, PXP aims to simplify and reduce the number of processes and especially heavy documentation that Personal Software Process (PSP) involves. PSP is the other and initial process explicitly specified for free-lance developers. However, applying PSP in practice is laborious for the software engineers as it requires extensive knowledge of the process specifications. 
  
  2.1. Methods
  In this section I should justify the data collection methods I used to conduct an evaluation. After significant consideration, I have decided to continue using the method in my research and planning stage, namely focus group and survey to gather users' experience with my app as well as their evaluation and level of satisfaction. Combining both methods, I have tried to benefit from the advantages of both. Focus group being face to face discussion in more free-leading way in oppose to the survey when the questions are pre-defined and conducted online, could not involve participation discussion.  

  3. Conclusion/Results
  The participants in the focus group and the survey expressed some level of satisfaction of the Sports buddies app by saying it is helpful and motivates them to exercise more. On the down side and as a limitation of the app, it is the lack of sufficient time and practice to implement more sophisticated software decisions, functions and interface. If I had more time and acquired more practice in a couple of similar projects, I would look to improve my application and tailored it more to the users' - Solent university students' needs.
